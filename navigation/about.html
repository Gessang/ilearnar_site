<div class="faq" onclick="toggleAnswer(3)">
  <div class="question">Q: How do you conduct your classes?</div>
  <div class="answer" id="answer3">A: A learner may choose more than one class type. However, 
    we recommend that those signing up for advanced communication class and public speaking for 
    kids online should schedule time to meet in group to engage the new skills learned and get 
    feedback from each other under their tutorsâ€™ supervision.</div>

  <div class="faq" onclick="toggleAnswer(4)">
    <div class="question">Q: What are the minimum requirements for people who wish to join your class?</div>
    <div class="answer" id="answer4">A: This depends on the class the person wants to join.
      For the English literacy class, the minimum requirement is the ability to 
      understand common English words (come, go, sit, stand, walk etc).
      For advanced communication class, the person is assumed to have learned 
      the basic English literacy skills ( reading, writing, speaking and spelling).
